# jtlstring
A solution of of a two-letter string problem.

## TASK

  The task is stated by a high society commerce java senior.

```java
There are two-letter strings, 'AA', 'AB' and 'BB', which appear AB, AB and BB
times respectevely. The task is to join some of these strings to create the
longest possible string which does not contain 'AAA' or 'BBB'.

Write a function:
  String solution(int AA, int AB, int BB)
that, given three integers AA, AB and BB, returns the longest string that can
be createdaccording to the rules described above. If there is more than one
possible answer, the function may return any of them.

Examples:
- Given AA = 5, AB = 0 and BB = 2, the function should return 'AABBAABBAA'.
- Given AA = 1, AB = 2 and BB = 1, possible results are 'BBABABAA',
  'ABAABBAB', 'ABABAABB' or 'AABBABAB'.
- Given AA = 0, AB = 2 and BB = 0, the function should return 'ABAB'.
- Given AA = 0, AB = 0 and BB = 10, the function should return 'BB'.
